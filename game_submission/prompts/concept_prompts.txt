ECOPOLIS: CONCEPT PROMPTS
Used for brainstorming and game design
===========================================

PROMPT 1: Initial Game Concept
-------------------------------
"Create a board game concept that teaches players about climate change and sustainability. The game should:
- Be engaging and fun to play
- Incorporate real-world environmental challenges
- Allow 2-6 players
- Take 60-120 minutes to play
- Include meaningful choices with tradeoffs between profit and environmental impact
- Be suitable for educational purposes
- Address both Vietnam and Australia contexts"

PROMPT 2: Game Mechanics Design
--------------------------------
"Design detailed game mechanics for an environmental board game that includes:
- Resource management (money, sustainability points, carbon footprint)
- Property ownership with different development paths (eco-friendly vs industrial)
- Card system for random events (positive and negative)
- Cooperative and competitive elements
- Policy voting system
- Progressive difficulty through CO2 thresholds
- Strategic actions beyond basic turn structure"

PROMPT 3: Educational Integration
----------------------------------
"How can we integrate these real-world sustainability concepts into game mechanics:
- Carbon footprint and emissions
- Renewable vs fossil fuel energy
- Green technology and innovation
- Community engagement and influence
- Policy-making and governance
- Short-term profit vs long-term sustainability
- Collective action problems
- Climate disasters and adaptation"

PROMPT 4: Player Engagement
----------------------------
"What game elements will keep players engaged and create memorable moments:
- Tension points (disasters, votes, shortages)
- Player interaction (trading, competition, cooperation)
- Meaningful choices (dilemmas with no clear right answer)
- Progression systems (upgrades, improvements)
- Surprise elements (cards, random events)
- Multiple paths to victory"

PROMPT 5: Balancing Challenge
------------------------------
"How do we balance the game so that:
- Eco path is viable but challenging
- Industrial path has real consequences
- No strategy is clearly dominant
- All players stay competitive until the end
- Cooperation has value even in competitive mode
- Early mistakes can be recovered from
- Late-game is exciting and unpredictable"

PROMPT 6: Theme Integration - Vietnam
--------------------------------------
"What environmental challenges specific to Vietnam should be represented:
- Mekong Delta vulnerability to sea level rise
- Urban air pollution in major cities
- Deforestation and biodiversity loss
- Rapid industrialization impacts
- Renewable energy adoption
- Community-based environmental action"

PROMPT 7: Theme Integration - Australia
----------------------------------------
"What environmental challenges specific to Australia should be represented:
- Bushfires and extreme heat
- Great Barrier Reef degradation
- Drought and water scarcity
- Coal vs renewable energy debate
- Wildlife habitat loss
- Indigenous land management practices"

PROMPT 8: Win Condition Design
-------------------------------
"Design a scoring system that rewards:
- Environmental stewardship (Sustainability Score)
- Economic success (EcoCredits)
- Social influence (Community Influence)
- Penalties for pollution (Carbon Tokens)
- Formula should make all factors matter
- No single metric should dominate
- Tie-breakers should be meaningful"

PROMPT 9: Card Content Generation
----------------------------------
"Create 15 positive event cards (Green Cards) that:
- Reward sustainable choices
- Provide resources or bonuses
- Reflect real innovations or policies
- Feel satisfying to receive
- Have varying impact levels

Create 12 crisis/challenge cards that:
- Present difficult choices
- Have multiple options with tradeoffs
- Reflect real climate challenges
- Create tension and drama
- Can be mitigated by good planning"

PROMPT 10: Replayability
-------------------------
"How can we ensure high replayability:
- Randomized card draws
- Variable board setup
- Multiple game modes
- Different strategies to explore
- Player count scaling
- Optional rules variants
- Emergent player interactions"
